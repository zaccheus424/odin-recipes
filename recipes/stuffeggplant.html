    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggplant: Youâ€™ll need one eggplant (halved lengthwise) to make two servings.</li>
        <li>Olive oil: Brush the shells with olive oil before seasoning with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: This stuffed eggplant is seasoned with salt, pepper, fresh garlic, and fresh basil.</li>
        <li>Sausage: Sweet Italian sausage makes this stuffed eggplant a hearty, crowd-pleasing meal.</li>
        <li>Vegetables: An onion and fresh mushrooms lend texture and flavor.</li>
        <li>Pasta sauce: Use store-bought or homemade tomato-basil pasta sauce.</li>
        <li>Bread crumbs: Italian-seasoned panko bread crumbs give the stuffed eggplant a welcome crunch.</li>
        <li>Cheese: For the most delicious results, grate your own Parmesan cheese instead of using the pre-shredded stuff.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
