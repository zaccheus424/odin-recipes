    <h1>Chocolate Cream Snack Cakes</h1>
    <img src="images/Chocolate Cream Snack Cakes.webp" alt="Chocolate Cream Snack Cakes image">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is more than just a cupcake; itâ€™s one that most people would recognize anywhere. Moist chocolate cake is partially hollowed out, filled with plenty of fluffy vanilla cream, 
        and dunked in a gloriously glossy chocolate glaze.</p>
    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for greasing pan</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup boiling water</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cup plus 2/3 cup white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>3 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 cup whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cup plus 1 1/2 teaspoons light corn syrup, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>2 large egg whites</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, cubed</li>
        <li>4 ounces bittersweet chocolate</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and position a rack in the center. Lightly butter top surface of a 12-cup muffin pan and put a cupcake liner in each cup.</li>
        <li>Whisk together cocoa powder and boiling water in a small heat-safe bowl until smooth. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat 1/2 cup butter and 1 1/4 cups sugar at medium speed until light and fluffy, 4 to 5 minutes; scrape bowl well. Mix in 2 eggs, one at a time, at medium speed, scraping bowl well after each addition. Mix in 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla.</li>
        <li>Mix in about 1/3 of flour mixture at low speed. Mix in half of cocoa mixture. Repeat, alternating between flour mixture and cocoa mixture, until fully incorporated and batter is smooth. Mix in cream.</li>
        <li>Divide batter among prepared muffin cups, filling each about 3/4 full. Bake until a toothpick inserted into center of a cake comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs, 22 to 25 minutes. Cool in pan 5 minutes, then use a small offset spatula or a knife to remove each cake; transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining 2/3 cup sugar, 1/3 cup corn syrup, and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring until sugar is dissolved. When bubbles start to form around edges, stop stirring. Use a pastry brush dipped in water to dissolve any sugar left on sides of pot. Cook, without stirring, until a candy thermometer registers 230 degreed F (110 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, put egg whites and cream of tartar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (bowl should be clean and dry). When sugar mixture reaches 230 degrees F (110 degrees C), start beating egg white mixture at medium-high speed. </li>
        <li>When sugar mixture reaches 240 degrees F (116 degrees C), remove from heat and add to egg white mixture in a slow, steady stream, beating until soft peaks form, 6 to 8 minutes more. Mix in remaining 2 teaspoons vanilla. Transfer vanilla cream to a disposable pastry bag and cut a 1/2-inch opening from tip.</li>
        <li>Use the base of a large round piping tip, a small round cookie cutter, or a paring knife to cut a hole out of the top of each cake. Pipe vanilla cream into holes. Top with a small piece of removed cake to help seal cream inside. Freeze cakes while you make the glaze (at least 15 minutes).</li>
        <li>Melt butter cubes, chocolate, and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons corn syrup in a double boiler or a heat-safe bowl set over simmering water, stirring occasionally, until mixture is smooth. Remove from heat; let cool 5 minutes. Stir before using.</li>
        <li>Dip top of each cake into glaze, allowing excess to drip off; transfer to a wire rack. Let stand until glaze sets completely. If desired, decorate tops of cakes with remaining vanilla cream. Chill in an airtight container until ready to serve, up to 4 days.</li>
